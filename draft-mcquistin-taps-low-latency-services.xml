                This document describes the set of transport services
                required by low-latency, real-time applications. These
                services are derived from the needs of the application,
                rather than from the current capabilities of the transport
                layer. An example API, based on the BSD Sockets API, is
                also provided, alongside examples of how the target
                applications would use the API to access the transport
                services described.

            <t>
                The goal of the TAPS working group is to break down the
                existing transport layer into a set of transport services,
                decoupling these from the transport protocols that provide
                them. As a result, the standardisation of transport
                services becomes feasible and important. The first phase of
                this process has been to inspect the existing transport
                protocols, and determine the services they provide. The
                next phase, enabled both by the use of transport services
                and their separation from transport protocols, is to define
                novel transport services based on the needs of
                applications. In essence, these services are derived from
                applications by thinking about what the transport layer
                would provide to applications if the constraints of the 
                existing transport protocols were not in place.

            <t>
                This document considers the transport services required by
                low-latency applications. This is an important class of
                applications, not only because it represents a significant
                portion of Internet traffic, but because it is arguably
                poorly served by the existing transport layer: the
                available transport protocols bundle services together in
                such a way that no one protocol provides all the services
                required.
            </t>
            <t>
                After detailing the transport services required by these
                applications, a sample API that provides these services is
                outlined. This API is then used to demonstrate how
                applications might make use of the transport services
                described.
            </t>

                This document does not consider how the transport services
                described map to the transport protocols that might provide
                them.

                The decoupling of transport services from transport
                protocols allows for the development of novel transport
                services, based on the needs of applications. This section
                describes the transport services required by low-latency
                applications.

                    <t hangText="Timing">
                        <vspace />
                        Timing is the most essential characteristic of the
                        data generated by low-latency applications. Data
                        has a lifetime associated with it: the time after
                        the data has been produced that it remains useful
                        to the receiving application. This lifetime depends
                        on the latency bounds of the application.
                        Interactive applications, such as telephony, video
                        conferencing, or telepresence, require a low
                        end-to-end latency, ranging from tens to a few
                        hundred milliseconds. Non-interactive applications
                        can accomodate higher latency, with bounds in the
                        order of seconds.
                    </t>
                    <t hangText="Partial Reliability">
                        <vspace />
                        The combination of a lossy, best-effort network
                        (e.g., IP) layer and support for timing and
                        lifetimes results in the need for a partially
                        reliable service. Given the limitations of forward
                        error correct techniques, there is some probability
                        that packet loss can only be recovered from by
                        retransmitting the lost packet. This introduces
                        potentially unbounded delay, given that
                        retransmissions themselves may be lost. Therefore,
                        timing and fully reliable transport services cannot
                        be provided together -- the reliable delivery of 
                        data cannot be guaranteed within a given lifetime.
                        <vspace /><vspace />
                        This implies a partial reliability service, where
                        data is delivered reliably while it is still likely
                        to be useful to the receiving application.
                        Retransmissions are not sent for data whose
                        lifetime has expired.
                    </t>
                    <t hangText="Dependencies">
                        <vspace />
                        Partial reliability means that not all data that is
                        sent will be received successfully. This means that
                        a dependency management transport service is
                        required. Data must not be sent if it relies upon
                        earlier data that has not been successfully
                        delivered.
                    </t>
                    <t hangText="Messaging">
                        <vspace />
                        The combination of partial reliability and packet
                        loss means that application-level framing is
                        required to maximise the utility of each received
                        packet. This implies a message-oriented service to
                        maintain application data unit boundaries.
                        <vspace /><vspace />
                        To minimise latency, messages are delivered to the
                        application in the order they arrive. Reordering
                        messages into transmission order introduces latency
                        when applied across a lossy IP network; messages
                        may be buffered waiting for earlier packets to
                        be retransmitted. Application-layer protocols, such
                        as RTP, introduce sequencing, allowing applications
                        to introduce order if required. Introducing order
                        at this layer makes the resultant latency explicit.

                        <vspace />
                        Messaging enables a multistreaming service. Many
                        applications are comprised of multiple streams,
                        each with their own characteristics with regards to
                        the other services listed. A multistreaming service
                        would allow these streams to be configured
                        separately.
                    </t>
                    <t hangText="Multipath">
                        <vspace />
                        Multiple paths often exist between hosts; a
                        multipath service is required to allow applications
                        to benefit from this. This is an extension of the
                        multistreaming service: different streams should
                        be mapped to the most suitable path, given the
                        configuration of the stream, and the network
                        conditions of the path. Messaging is required to
                        make optimal use of multiple paths with different
                        loss and delay characteristics.

                        <vspace />
                        Congestion control is an essential service. A given
                        algorithm is not suitable for all traffic types,
                        and so one is not prescribed. The service should 
                        require the use of a suitable congestion control
                        algorithm, and enforce this using a circuit
                        breaker.

                        Maintaining per-connection metdata at the endpoints
                        is helpful for the implementation of many 
                        congestion control algorithms. Further, connection
                        setup and teardown messages can also benefit
                        in-network services, including NAT traversal and
                        firewall pinhole management. As a result, it is
                        often desirable to have support for a
                        connection-oriented service.

                This set of transport services demonstrates the need for
                a top-down approach. Timing is a crucial characteristic of
                low-latency applications, from which the other services

                The transport services described do not themselves
                introduce any security considerations beyond those of
                TCP or UDP. The delivery model (partially reliable
                message delivery) enables the use of Datagram TLS,
                allowing for security. No additional metadata needs to be
                exposed on the wire to provide the transport services
                described.
            </t>
            <t>
                It is likely that to see widespread deployability, these
                transport services will need to be implemented within
                either UDP or TCP. Doing so within UDP does not raise
                any security considerations beyond standard UDP.
                Implementing the services on top of TCP fundamentally
                changes how the protocol behaves, and this change in
                behaviour is visible to middleboxes in the network.
                Care must be taken to ensure that applications are not
                penalized by this.
